# Game Design Notes:
# Puzzler with no dangers, per se. Only ways out are to starve to death on purpose or after X turns, or to win.
# Time-machine based with 3 rooms:
# - Central time core
# - Numbers Room (1, 2, 3), activate by entering proper numbers
# - Letter Room (A, B, C), activate by entering proper words
# Rooms can only be activated with correct puzzle entry AND correct time of day.
